Abstract
========

Natural Language Processing is a scientific field in the area of Computer Science, which seeks a better correlation between natural language and computers. In fact Natural Language Processing is a wide scientific field in which technologies such as "Machine Translation", "Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation", "Sentiment Analysis" and more are included. This Thesis seeks a better approach in order to export information from plain texts, which basically contain civil placements on consultation laws issued by the Greek Government. Attempted to export proposals - counterproposal of the authors and also the arguments that the authors expressed. Finally attempted to export the entire view of the author summarized in a word "Positive" or "Negative", according to the opinion that the author expressed in the text. To export of these data is made entirely by analysing texts through a three step process (which will be explained in detail in the following chapter of this Thesis) and implementing techniques from the wide spectrum of NLP (such as Information Retrieval, Part-Of-Speech Tagging, Sentiment Analysis, etc.). The results show that we can create realistic methods in order to export this type of Semantic Information. Recently the research community gives more interesting on this subject, because ic could be exploited in a number of other areas outside the field of Computer Science (eg. Journalism, Politics, etc.).
